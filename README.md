# UsageðŸ—¿
Navigate to the directory that contains these codes and open cmd/terminal in it then type;
``` 
pip install scapy --user
```
After that type "python3 http.py" to start http flooding; type "python3 syn.py" to start syn flooding which is more effective than http flooding.

# ReminderðŸ—¿
It won't effect much if you're doing it from one machine.

# EssentialðŸ—¿
I don't accept any responsibilities. I took some lines from Neural Nine in the http file.

# Extrasâ˜•
You can use spoofing in syn flooding. You can change the message in syn file by changing the "Raw" variable.
